## ✨ Why This Project?
I've been away from **Flutter** for a while, and I wanted to get back into it by **building something simple yet effective**. The goal of this project is:
- **Re-learning Flutter development** and exploring new improvements since my last experience.
- Experimenting with **modern Flutter UI** components, theming, and **state management**.
- Trying out the latest **Flutter Slidable, Hive for local storage, and enhanced animations**.
- Making this a **public project** to showcase my skills and help others learn.
